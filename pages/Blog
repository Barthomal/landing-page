One day I looked in the mirror and had a good look at myself. I had this sudden realization that if I did not make changes to improve my health, I was going to die young and unsatisfied. There were many things I wanted to see and do, but its hard to follow-up when you lack all motivation due to constant fatigue, lack of energy, and negative self-image. So I made a choice to put myself through temporary pain and discomfort in exchange for creating a better version of myself to move on into the future. Do you want to know the good news? The pain and discomfort is truly temporary. It will take some time, but if you are consistent you will begin to embrace these changes.
